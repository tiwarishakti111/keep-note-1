## 🎨 Design Decisions

### UI/UX Choices
- **Clean, Modern Design**: Focused on usability and visual appeal
- **Card-Based Layout**: Easy scanning and interaction with notes
- **Modal-Based Editing**: Focused editing experience without page navigation
- **Responsive Grid**: Adapts to different screen sizes seamlessly
- **Consistent Color Scheme**: Professional indigo/blue theme throughout

### Technical Decisions
- **Zustand over Redux**: Simpler state management for this scope
- **localStorage**: Client-side persistence (would be replaced with API in full-stack)
- **TypeScript**: Better developer experience and code reliability
- **Component Composition**: Reusable, maintainable component architecture

### Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy Loading**: Components loaded as needed
- **Efficient Re-renders**: Proper state management prevents unnecessary updates
- **Optimized Bundle**: Vite's efficient bundling and tree-shaking
- **Responsive Images**: Proper sizing for different screen densities

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **Input Validation**: All forms include proper validation
- **XSS Prevention**: Proper text sanitization
- **State Isolation**: User data properly scoped and isolated
- **No Sensitive Data**: No hardcoded secrets or API keys

## 📝 Future Enhancements

- **Rich Text Editor**: Enhanced note editing capabilities
- **Search Functionality**: Find notes quickly
- **Categories/Tags**: Organize notes better
- **Export Options**: PDF, markdown export
- **Collaborative Features**: Share notes with others

## 🧪 Testing

- **Cross-browser compatibility** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Responsive design** (Mobile, tablet, desktop)
- **User flows** (Sign-up, sign-in, CRUD operations)
- **Error handling** (Network errors, validation errors)
- **Data persistence** (localStorage functionality)
